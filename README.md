# Food Order System using MySQL and JDBC

This project is a food ordering system that utilizes MySQL as the database management system and JDBC for database connectivity. It allows users to browse food items, place orders, and manage orders in a restaurant. 

## Features

- User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their details such as name, email, and password.

- Login and Authentication: Registered users can log in to the system using their email and password. Authentication is performed to ensure the security of user accounts.

- Browse Food Items: Users can view a list of available food items with details such as name, description, and price.

- Place Orders: Users can select food items, specify quantities, and add them to their cart. They can then proceed to place the order, providing delivery address and payment details.

- Order Management: Users can view and manage their orders, including checking the order status and canceling orders if necessary.

## Technologies Used

- MySQL: The project utilizes MySQL as the database management system to store food items, user information, and order details.

- JDBC: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is used for connecting to the MySQL database from the Java application.

- Java: The project is implemented in Java, providing the necessary classes and logic for user management, food item management, and order processing.
